# NeXplorer

Hybrid Cross-platform file browser, basically  made with NWJS for desktop, but can be used on the web as well.
use cases:

- You can run it as executable on any OS supported by NWJS, that is Windows, MacOS and Linux (default ready-made)
- You can embed it in any web application or website...(you will need to provide an API for accessing the file system in that case)
